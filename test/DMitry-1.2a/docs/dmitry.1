       DMitry   (Deepmagic   Information  Gathering  Tool)  is  a
       UNIX/(GNU)Linux Command Line program  coded  purely  in  C
       with the ability to gather as much information as possible
       about a host.

       DMitry has a base functionality with the  ability  to  add
       new  functions.   Basic functionality of DMitry allows for
       information to be gathered about a target host from a sim-
       ple  whois  lookup on the target to UpTime reports and TCP
       portscans.

       The application is considered a tool to assist in informa-
       tion  gathering  when  information  is required quickly by
       removing the need  to  enter  multiple  commands  and  the
       timely  process  of  searching  through data from multiple
       sources.

       To get straight into DMitry without reading this document,
       you  can initially type "dmitry target", this will perform
       the majority of functions on the target.

       Options  should  be  passed  to  DMitry  in  the  form  of
       '-option'.   Only options known by DMitry will be used and
       others will be ignored.  If options are not  passed  as  a
       group  block,  the  trailing  options will be considered a
       host target.

       --oo ffiilleennaammee
              Create an ascii text output of the results  to  the
              "filename"  specified.   If  no  output filename is
              specified  then  output  will  be  saved  to  "tar-
              get.txt".   If  this option is not specified in any
              form output will be sent  to  the  standard  output
              (STDOUT)  by  default.   This option MUST trail all
              other options, i.e. "./dmitry -winseo target".

       --ii     Perform an Internet Number whois lookup on the tar-
              get.   This requires that the target be in the form
              of a 4 part Internet Number with each octal  seper-
              ated using the `.' notation. For example, "./dmitry
              -i 255.255.255.255".

       --ww     Perform a whois lookup on the 'host' target.   This
              requires  that  the  target be in a named character
              format.  For example,  "./dmitry  -w  target"  will
              perform a standard named whois lookup.

       --nn     Retrieve  netcraft.com  data  concerning  the host,
              this includes Operating System, Web Server  release
              and UpTime information where available.

       --ss     Perform a SubDomain search on the specified target.
              This will use serveral search engines to attempt to
              locate  sub-domains  in  the  form  of  sub.target.
              There is no set limit to the  level  of  sub-domain
              that  can  be  located, however, there is a maximum
              string length of 40 characters (NCOL 40)  to  limit
              memory usage.

       --ee     Perform  an  EmailAddress  search  on the specified
              target.  This modules works using the same  concept
              as  the  SubDomain  search  by attempting to locate
              possible e-mail addresses for a target  host.   The
              e-mail  addresses  may  also  be  for possible sub-
              domains of the target host.  There is  a  limit  to
              the  length of the e-mail address set to 50 charac-
              ters (NCOL 50) to limit memory usage.

       --pp     Perform a TCP Portscan on the host target.  This is
              a  pretty  basic  module  at  the moment, and we do
              advise users to use something like nmap  (www.inse-
              cure.org/nmap/)  instead.   This  module  will list
              open, closed and filtered ports within  a  specific
              range.   There  will probably be little advancement
              upon this module, though there will be some  alter-
              ations  to  make  it  a  little more user friendly.
              There are also other options for this  module  that
              can affect the scan and its relative output.

       --ff     This  option  will cause the TCP Portscan module to
              report/display output of filtered ports.  These are
              usually ports that have been filtered and/or closed
              by a firewall at the specified  host/target.   This
              option requires that the '-p' option be passed as a
              previous option.  For example, "./dmitry  -pf  tar-
              get".

       --bb     This  option  will cause the TCP Portscan module to
              output Banners if they are received  when  scanning
              TCP  Ports.   This  option  requres  that  the '-p'
              option be passed as a previous option.   For  exam-
              ple, "./dmitry -pb target".

       --tt     This  sets  the  Time To Live (TTL) of the Portscan
              module when scanning individual ports.  This is set
              to  2 seconds by default.  This is usually required
              when scanning a host that has a firewall and/or has
              filtered ports which can slow a scan down.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
       This  section  presents  some  example queries that can be
       made using dmitry.  The hosts  and  targets  used  in  the
       examples are merely used for demonstration.

       ddmmiittrryy --ww eexxaammppllee--hhoosstt..ccoomm

       This will perform a named whois (INIC-WHOIS) lookup on the
       target host, displaying results  to  the  standard  output
       (STDOUT).

       ddmmiittrryy --wwiinnsseeppoo ssoommeetteexxttffiillee..ttxxtt eexxaammppllee--hhoosstt..ccoomm

       This  will  perform  all the basic functions on the target
       host and store all the output into "sometextfile.txt".

       ddmmiittrryy --wwiinnsseeppoo eexxaammppllee--hhoosstt..ccoomm

       This will perform all the basic functions  on  the  target
       host and store all the output into "example-host.com.txt".

       ddmmiittrryy --wwiinnsseeppffbboo 112277..00..00..11

       This will perform all the basic functions  on  the  target
       host  and store all the output into "127.0.0.1.txt".  This
       will also display banners and show filtered ports.
